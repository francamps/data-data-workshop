Workshop description : steps.

For this workshop, we are going to make a website that gives you acces to the most viral youtube videos uploaded within 100m from here.

In order to do so, we need
Data from youtube.
A html page
A way to query and change the data.

First, you need subscribe to the youtube api
s://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard?project=test-159315&duration=PT1H

Once you have subscribed to this API, we need to acces the data we want :
A ranking of the most viewed videos within 100m.
Whenever you work with API, you always want to check the documentation in order to get started
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list

In order to get the data we need, we have to enter the url that corresponds to the data we want to access.
https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&type=video&location=48.881311,2.076968&locationRadius=1km&order=viewCount&key=A

When we get on this page, we can see the raw data that corresponds to our query.
The data is stored as as a JSON format.

Using P5, you can access this data and convert it to annother form
—how to load JSON file
—how to parse it to get only the relevant information
—how to display this info in a graphical form (text, HTML output?)
