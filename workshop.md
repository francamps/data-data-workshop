Data-Data Workshop
==================

Overview
--------
- This is a student-run workshop, framed within the Desense elective, run by John Fass and Matt Lewis, within the IED Master at the Royal College of Art, London, in the spring term of 2017.
- Taught by Thibaut Evrard and Franc Camps-Febrer.
- The workshop is provided _as is_, with no guarantees of epiphanies or life-changing experiences, but a positive hope of being helpful.

Descirption
------------

In this workshop we will learn how to use data to express, analyze and create. We will go through some of
the most common formats and we will review a couple of easy ways of obtaining data.

What is data? And what can be done with it?
-------------------------------------------

Data art, visualization or sonification are forms of translation and mapping from data onto perceptual experiences that may provide different channels to incorporate sensory and intellectual information in our models.

### What are some common data formats?

Let\'s talk about data formats: JSON, CSV, XML

### What are some examples of data art / visualization / design?

Exercise 1
----------

We will use a prepackaged JSON file and play around with it using p5.

What is open Data? 
------------------

Open Data repositories examples:
- [UK GOV](https://data.gov.uk/)
- [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/)

What is an API?
--------------

We will look at what exactly is an API, what can be done with them?

Examples can be found here:
- [Programmable Web - a long list of available APIs](http://www.programmableweb.com)

Exercise 2
----------

We will be using live API data to visualize / sonify / texify it and play around
