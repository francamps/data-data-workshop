Exercise 1: Data Sunrise
========================

Here we will use some weather data in JSON format to visualize the different times at which the sun rises in different cities in the world.

We will work with a JSON file with some weather and geographical data and we will build a visualization of the time at which the sun rises in 5 cities around the world.

We will use data obtained from OpenWeatherData, but you don't have to download it from there, we did for you.

Before starting
---------------

You will need p5's IDE and a JSON file included here called [5cities\_mini.json](5cities\_mini.json).

Let's take a look at the file first.

Download (p5.js' editor from here)[].

**IMPORTANT** P5 is a young library and is a community-run project. This editor has been deprecated in pro of a web editor that is not yet ready. We think using this editor for a workshop is useful because it helps us focus on the code and the data, and forget about putting a site together or running a server, but be aware that this editor may stop working in the future. If you want to keep working with p5 you should probably learn to use it in a regular browser or more generic editor like Atom or Sublime.
