Exercise 1: Data Sunrise
========================

![The sun](http://cdn0.techly.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tumblr_nr2569nqX01qze3hdo1_r2_500.gif)

Here we will play with some downloaded data. We will work with a JSON file with some weather and geographical data from [Open Weather Map](http://www.openweathermap.org/current) and we will build a visualization of the time at which the sun rises in 5 cities around the world.

Before starting
---------------

You will need p5's IDE and a JSON file included here called [5cities\_mini.json](5cities\_mini.json).

You will also need to download [p5.js' editor from here](https://p5js.org/download/). 

As an alternative to the editor, you can also use the template for a website in the folder [source](source). In fact, we suggest you learn how to manipulate the files themselves, but you can try that on your own.

**IMPORTANT** P5 is a young library based on Processing, and is a community-run project. This editor has been deprecated in pro of a web editor that is not yet ready. We think using this editor for a workshop is useful because it helps us focus on the code and the data, and forget about putting a site together or running a server, but be aware that this editor may stop working in the future. If you want to keep working with p5 you should probably learn to use it in a regular browser or more generic editor like Atom or Sublime.
